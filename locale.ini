//
//    PixelVision is setup by default for the use of Steam in English. If you are using Steam in another
//    language, you'll have to specify which language in order for the skin to properly adapt. To do so,
//    follow these instructions carefully:
//
//	1. Find your language in the list below, for example:	   // Russian
//
//	2. The next line should look something like this:	   //include "[...]/russian.styles"
//
//	3. Delete the 2 slashes "//" in the line from step 2:	   include "[...]/russian.styles"
//
//	4. Save this file and restart Steam.
